1 I need to subset my training data
2 I need to test my submissions against themselves to get a preliminary score
3 I should write a program that does this
4 I should write the mean benchmark
5 I should compare if weighing different variables in the average, which is better
6 I should save all of my steps
7 Clean them up, put them all on github
